will provide documentaiton shortly
note to self for when writing documentation: you need to be a member of group fuse

TODOs:
- tell rsc to handle Intr in fuse.Tree.ReadDir because killing that (for instance, using control-C to cancel a long ls or shell glob) panics the entire server out
- battles seems to require reloading the game to catch parent (xevious)
  there are several others; this is the first one for which I remember to add the TODO
